    This function takes a 2D array and two integers as
    input and returns a 2D array that is a slice of the input array.
    The slice is taken from the start index to the end index (exclusive)
    of each list in the input array.
    The input array is a list of lists, where each list represents a person
    and contains the height and weight of the person.
